6. The features you want to implement and how they interface together:
        + The core algorithm: Train moving along 1 path with subsequence train lining up
        + The bonus algorithm: Solving the case when there are multiple stations before the ending stations -> no bottleneck
        + Pyglet representation of the train moving and metro system, based on the objects and actions defined in the previous features
